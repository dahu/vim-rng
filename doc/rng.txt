                                                *rng*
INTRODUCTION ~

rng provides random numbers, characters and Strings at a specifiable
length. Random characters can be within a range or constrained to a
set of characters.

                                      *rng-functions*
FUNCTIONS ~

RandomNumber()
This returns a random 32 bit number between.
>
  e.g.
  :echo RandomNumber()
  2073985768
<

Additionally, the following functions are available to control rng
through Vimscript:

* rngOn()
* rngOff()
* rngToggle(boolean)

                                  *rng-configuration*
CONFIGURATION ~

Several aspects of rng can be configured from your $HOME/.vimrc
file. Control whether rng is on automatically when Vim starts, the
colour of the highlighting and the keys used to turn rng on and off.

                                  *rng-activation*
Automatic Activation ~

rng is disabled by default. To enable it automatically, add the
following line to your $HOME/.vimrc:
>
  let g:rng = 1
<

                                  *rng-highlighting*
Highlighting ~

The rng highlight group defines the colours and attributes of the
striped lines (green background by default). This can be changed by
adding a line like the following to your $HOME/.vimrc:
>
  hi rng ctermbg=grey guibg=grey
<

                                  *rng-keymaps*
Key Maps ~

By default, rng is turned on with the key map <leader>z and off with
<leader>Z.

rng uses <plug> maps so you can override the defaults. Here is an
example you could put in your $HOME/.vimrc:

>
  nmap <leader>x <plug>rngOn
  nmap <leader>X <plug>rngOff
<
